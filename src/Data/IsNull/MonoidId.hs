-- | I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
--
-- "Data.Monoid" @'mempty'@ is /not/ a synonym for empty or null.
-- It just means that it is the identity of the @'Monoid'@ binary operation.
-- As a counter example, @getProduct mempty == 1@. Does that seem \'null\' to you?
--
-- Nevertheless, many older or not so maintained modules indeed have a monoid instance
-- meaning \'empty\', and lack a proper @'Foldable'@ instance, thus this module
-- can be useful for those cases.
--
-- However, a too general use can lead to /_WRONG_/ results.
--
-- You have been warned!
